When I got the code, it was working but had serious real-world risks. So I focused on fixing the biggest problems first, while keeping the project simple and functional.

The Critical Issues I Fixed:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Passwords Were Stored in Plaintext (Critical Security Flaw)
Original code was storing raw passwords in the database.

I fixed this by hashing passwords using PBKDF2-SHA256 before storing them.

Also, during login, I securely verify the password using hash comparison instead of direct string matching.

2Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Injection Vulnerability
The app was building SQL queries using f-strings, which is dangerous.

I replaced all of them with safe parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Code Was All In One Big File (No Separation of Concerns)
All the DB code, route handling, and business logic were mixed together.

I reorganized the codebase into a clean structure:

/models ‚Üí Handles DB queries.

/routes ‚Üí Handles API endpoints.

/utils ‚Üí Helper functions for authentication and validation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Database Connection Handling Was Unsafe
The code was using a global SQLite connection shared by all API requests.

I refactored it to create a new DB connection per request, making it safe for multiple users hitting the API.

5Ô∏è‚É£ No Input Validation
Incoming request data wasn‚Äôt being checked ‚Äî anyone could send bad/malicious data.

I added basic input validation to ensure required fields are present and valid before proceeding.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Inconsistent API Responses & Status Codes
API was returning plain text responses with no proper status codes.

I standardized all responses to be structured JSON and return correct HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404).

7Ô∏è‚É£ Sensitive Data (Passwords) Were Being Returned in API Responses
Originally, when fetching user data, the password field was also returned.

I fixed this by ensuring sensitive fields like passwords are never sent in API responses.

üóÇÔ∏è Why I Didn't Add DB Environments or Cloud DBs
Since the app uses SQLite (a local file-based DB), there‚Äôs no need for external DB environments.

I didn‚Äôt add environment variables for DB configs because the SQLite DB path is static and local.

Setting up a cloud database or full environment config would have been unnecessary for this assignment.

The focus was on fixing code-level issues, not infrastructure deployment.

üéØ My Approach & Focus:
Fix real-world security risks first (Passwords, SQL Injection).

Make the code organized and maintainable.

Ensure API remains fully functional after refactor.


I didn‚Äôt over-engineer ‚Äî I kept it simple and solved the problems that matter in a real production scenario.
